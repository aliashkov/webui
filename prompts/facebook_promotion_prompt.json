        "1. Go to google.com, search for 'facebook.com', click it in 'Search in Google'. After that navigate to first link.",
        "2. Log in if necessary.",
        "3. **Browse First:** Spend approximately 5-10 seconds exploring the Facebook News Feed. Look for posts or suggestions that seem to belong to popular music Pages (artists, labels, genres) or active music Groups.",
        "4. **Identify Candidate Page/Group (from Browsing):**",
        "    a. If you find a promising post on the News Feed, click on the Page or Group name associated with it to navigate to its main profile/page.",

        "    b. Try varied search terms like specific popular genres ('popular electronic music page', 'official rock music group'), general terms ('trending music artists', 'music discussion community'), or artist types. Focus on finding *Pages* or *Groups*. **Do not exclusively use generic terms like 'music'**. If one search term leads to Pages/Groups you already follow/belong to or ineligible ones, try a *different* search term.",

        "        iii. Navigate to the Page's main feed or the Group's discussion/posts tab (if not already there).",
        "        iv. Select a relevant, recent, or popular **post** (e.g., a music video share, a song link, an artist update, a relevant discussion thread). Ensure it's actual content *posted by* or *within* this Page/Group.",

        "    d. **CRITICAL CHECK 2:** Confirm that you have *not* already posted the HitzMe comment on *any* post during *this specific task execution*. If you have already posted the one required comment, **STOP IMMEDIATELY**.",
        "    e. If both critical checks pass (correct Page/Group post AND the single HitzMe comment for this task has *not* yet been posted):",
        "        i. Read/view the post content to understand its topic/vibe.",
        "        ii. Write a *single* new comment that:",

        "            - Optionally, ends with an engaging question related to the artist, music, or post topic (e.g., 'What do you all think?', 'Anyone else excited for their new album?', 'Can't wait to hear more!').",
        "            - **CRITICAL: The comment must NOT contain any emojis.** Do not click on any emoji buttons or insert emojis while writing.",
        "            - **VERY IMPORTANT: Generate a *unique and different* comment each time, tailored to the specific post.** Do *not* simply copy or reuse the example below or comments from previous task attempts. Be creative and specific.",
        "            - **Example Comment Structure (Use as a guide for structure ONLY, DO NOT COPY VERBATIM):** 'This track has such a cool vibe! Itâ€™s exactly the kind of sound we love sharing on HitzMe. What's everyone's favorite part?'",
        "        iii. **Post the comment ONE TIME ONLY.**",
        "    f. After successfully posting the comment:",
        "        i. Wait approximately 5-10 seconds for the comment to appear.",
        "        ii. Scroll down *briefly* through the existing comments left by other users (optional simulation).",
        "        iii. **FINAL STEP & TASK TERMINATION:** You have now successfully posted the required single comment. **STOP ALL ACTIONS AND TERMINATE THIS TASK EXECUTION IMMEDIATELY.** Do not proceed further, do not look for other posts, Pages, or Groups, do not post any more comments.
