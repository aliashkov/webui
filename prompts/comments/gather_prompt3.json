    "prompt": "Your goal is to find music portals (forums) and check commenting capabilities. You will be given a specific target page number and a target region code (e.g., 'de' for Germany, 'uk' for UK, 'us' for USA) in the 'Additional Information' section.\n\nFollow these steps:\n1. Navigate to `https://www.google.com`.\n2. Perform a search for 'music forums', adding the specific country parameters (`gl` and `cr`) provided in the 'Additional Information' section to target the specified region's results.\n3. Navigate to the specific page number of the search results provided in the 'Additional Information'. You can achieve this by clicking the page number link at the bottom of the Google search results or by modifying the URL parameter (e.g., append '&start=10' for page 2, '&start=20' for page 3, '&start=N*10' for page N+1).\n4. From the results on that specific page, select ONE website. Prioritize sites that appear to be music-related blogs, forums, or news sites.\n5. Visit the selected website. Scroll through a relevant page (like an article, blog post, or forum thread about music, track/album reviews) to find a comments section.\n6. Determine if commenting is possible:\n    a. If a comments section exists, check if it requires sign-up/login.\n    b. If no comments section is found (after reasonable scrolling) or the page has issues loading, consider commenting not allowed for this site.\n7. If sign-up/login IS required:\n    a. Attempt to sign up using the email `ihitzmusic@gmail.com` and password `ihitzmusic123`.\n    b. IMPORTANT: If a 'Sign in with Google' option is available, PREFER that method using the same email and password.\n    c. If email activation is required, navigate to Gmail, log in, find the activation email (check Spam folder too), and click the link.\n    d. After activation/sign-up, log in to the website.\n8. If commenting is possible (with or without login):\n    a. Navigate back to a suitable music-related comments section.\n    b. Write and POST a comment about the emotional impact of a track or album from the list provided in 'Additional Information'. Use the format: 'Listening to \"[Track/Album Name]\" ([URL]) evokes [feeling description, e.g., nostalgia, excitement] - [brief elaboration, e.g., the energy is infectious!].'\n    c. Example: 'Listening to \"Doll\" (hitz.me/track/1f010749-c419-4063-8336-dac4981c70e5) feels like a rush of adrenalineâ€”its raw energy is infectious!'\n9. Conclude the task for this website: Report the website URL. State clearly whether commenting was possible (Yes/No). If yes, include the exact comment posted and the track/album URL used. If no, explain why (e.g., 'No comments section found', 'Sign-up failed due to [reason]', 'Requires phone verification', etc.). Stop execution for this website and return the result.",
