Try varied search terms like specific popular genres ('popular electronic music channels', 'official rock music'), general terms ('trending music', 'official music channels'), or artist types. **Do not exclusively use 'top music hits'**. If one search term leads to channels you are subscribed to or ineligible channels, try a *different* search term.",
